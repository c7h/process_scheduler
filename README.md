#Process Scheduling Visualizer
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/c7h/process_scheduler.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/c7h/process_scheduler)

This is one part of my [Bachelorthesis from 2015](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-DFXUEGSqNuWnRkU2VJeWxud2c). There is also [a frontend](https://github.com/c7h/process_scheduling_api), which you can find in a separate repository.
